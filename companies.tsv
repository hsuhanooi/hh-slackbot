Activate Healthcare|Activate Healthcare engages patients to take charge of their own health by delivering proactive, preventive primary care at or near an employer’s location. Predictive modeling tools are leveraged to identify high-risk patients so the medical staff can engage with these patients to proactively reduce their health risks and guide them in managing their health. Activate Healthcare provides a comprehensive process to engage and empower patients to manage their health. It begins with an annual physical which enables our staff to know more about the patient before he or she meets with the doctor than many physicians know after the visit. During the annual physical, the patient usually spends 30 – 45 minutes with the physician undergoing a comprehensive physical. Patients then meet for 30 – 45 minutes with a Health Coach to develop tailored action plans and health goals along with individualized incentives for reaching their goals. Online resources, and tailored ongoing coaching empowers patients to achieve their specific health goals.|acquired|2009
