During the annual physical, the patient usually spends 30 – 45 minutes with the physician undergoing a comprehensive physical. Patients then meet for 30 – 45 minutes with a Health Coach to develop tailored action plans and health goals along with individualized incentives for reaching their goals.

Graematter|The original concept for the regulatory intelligence system was conceived by Graematter’s founder, Melissa Walker, in 1999. An early-stage, pre-prototype version of the system was first created in 2000. It began as an effort to simply improve the ability to locate key information. As the volume of regulatory information began to expand dramatically and as the regulatory environment became increasingly complex, it continued to evolve. Over time, Ms. Walker developed an intelligence system that provided simple, lower cost ways to better retrieve and analyze large amounts of data that reside in numerous locations. The evolving system has been in continuous use in actual applications during that time as its capabilities were expanded and improved.|alive|2000

Isolation Sciences|Isolation Sciences LLC, in developing innovative technological platforms, is positioning itself as a leader in developing unique innovative but practical solutions to meet market airborne containment needs and desires. The market problem being addresses is to correct the imbalance between access to the interior of an enclosure and isolation of the interior of the enclosure to the surrounding environment. A fume hood, a containment enclosure, with the sash up allows full accessibility to the interior of the fume hood but provides poor containment of toxic and obnoxious fume hood contamination. On the other extreme, one has very poor and limited access to the interior of a glove box but has high level of isolation of the enclosure contents. The Continuous Access Port solves this dilemma by offering total access to the interior of an enclosure with a high level of containment to keep contaminants from escaping into the surrounding environment where it can do harm to personnel and the environment. Other applications of the Continuous Access Port technology platform will be developed in medical, industrial and hazardous material remediation markets|dead|2005
